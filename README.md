# Lab 5: Web Frameworks Exploration

This repository contains demonstrations of three modern web development frameworks/tools:
- Bootstrap (component-based CSS framework)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework)
- React.js (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)

## Completed Features

### Bootstrap Demo: 
-Added styled button and alert components
-Developed a responsive navbar 
-Added a two-column layout using Bootstrap grid 
-Used only Bootstrap classes (no custom CSS)  

### The Tailwind CSS Demo 
-included a responsive card layout, an image, a headline, and a call-to-action button. 
-Tailwind utility classes were used for styling, and the `md:` prefix was used to implement responsive design.  

### React.js Demo:
-Using props, a functional component was created  
-Using `useState`, state management was implemented. 
-An interactive button was added to toggle message visibility.
-The declarative React methodology was used.  

## Framework Comparisons

### Bootstrap
- **Pros**: Quick to implement, consistent design, many pre-built components
- **Cons**: Less customization, heavier footprint if only using small parts

### Tailwind CSS
- **Pros**: Highly customizable, no context switching between files, responsive design easy
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, HTML can get cluttered with classes

### React
- **Pros**: Component reusability, declarative syntax, efficient DOM updates
- **Cons**: Initial setup complexity, JSX learning curve

## Experience Summary

-I would probably choose Bootstrap for sites with a lot of content or for fast prototypes. Tailwind's utility approach is appealing for projects where design originality is important. Additionally, even though React's component model has a higher learning curve, it feels essential for interactive web applications. I learned from this lab that each tool is best suited for a particular situation, and that combining them is frequently advantageous in contemporary web development (e.g., React with Tailwind).
